# Data formats

When it comes to reading/writing data in `Matlab`, there are a few options.

**Matlab-specific formats**  

- `.mat` files

**Domain-specific formats**  

- Data formats specific to certain applications: e.g., EEG data, fMRI data, Eye
  tracking data

- Cognitive neuroscience science-specific formats: e.g., BIDS (Brain Imaging
  Data Structure)


**General data formats**

- `.csv` (comma-separated values)

- `.json` (JavaScript Object Notation)

The different formats have different advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes
you'll have a choice in the format you use, and sometimes you won't. 

---

# `Matlab` specific format

The easiest format to use in `Matlab` is the `.mat` format

```matlab
`r paste0(xfun::read_utf8("../../code/part3/save_data.m"), collapse="\n")`
```

With the `save` command, you can quickly and easily save the entire workspace.


```matlab
`r paste0(xfun::read_utf8("../../code/part3/load_data.m"), collapse="\n")`
```

And with the `load` command, you can quickly load a `.mat` file into the
workspace.

---

## `.mat` files

Using `save` and `load` to save and load `.mat` files is quick and easy, but
there are a few downsides 

- Saves the **entire** workspace, which could be **HUGE** (many gigabytes if
  you're working with imaging data)

- Loads **all** the saved data at once (again, possibly **HUGE**), which can
  overwrite variables (without warning) if you have naming conflicts.

- It's not easy to work with `.mat` files in other languages (e.g., it's
  **extremely** slow to open them in `R`â€”on the order of minutes, even for
  relatively small files).

---

## Selectively saving and loading

Instead of saving the entire workspace, we can use the `save` function to save
particular variables. 

You just need to list the **names** of the variables you want to save.

**Saving specific variables**  

```matlab
`r paste0(xfun::read_utf8("../../code/part3/create_many_save_few.m"), collapse="\n")`
```

---

## Selectively saving and loading

You can also selectively load variables in a `.mat` file.

Again, you just need to list the **names** of the variables you want to load.

**Loading specific variables**  

```matlab
`r paste0(xfun::read_utf8("../../code/part3/load_few.m"), collapse="\n")`
```

Alternately, in case there are naming conflicts, you can load the content of a
`.mat` file into a variable

**Loading into a variable**  

```matlab
`r paste0(xfun::read_utf8("../../code/part3/load_into_var.m"), collapse="\n")`
```

---


## Domain-specific formats

**Typically**, you'll be working with domain-specific formats.

- Formats specific to EEGLab or FieldTrip 

- NIfTI/DICOM for MRI data

However, there's also a generic format for storing all stored to cognitive
neuroscience data called [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io)

- MRI Data

- M/EEG

- iEEG

- Behavioural data

- Genetic data

I think the usage of the BIDS format will become more and more common because it
doesn't lock you into any specific programming platform (e.g., `Matlab` or
`Python`) or any specific analysis toolbox (e.g., SPM, FieldTrip, EEGlab)

---

## General data formats

Finally, there are a few general-purpose data formats that you'll be familiar
with from using, e.g., `R` and `Python`.

**CSV files**  

- `.csv` files are good for storing matrices of numbers

- They're easy to import into `R`, `Python` and `SPSS`

However, matrices in `Matlab` don't have column headers (e.g., they're not
tables) so column headers will be missing when you read the data in to `R`

`Matlab` has some build in functions for reading data from `.csv` files into
matrices and for writing matrices into `.csv` files that we'll use in the
activities, but we'll also look at some alternatives.


---

**Tips for working with `.csv` files**

- Check out the `Matlab` **file exchange** for [a simple
  function](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29933-csv-with-column-headers)
  for writing `.csv` files with headers. You'll need a matrix that holds the
  data and another cell array that holds the header

- Convert the matrix to a **table** (tables are `Matlab`'s version of a
  data.frame).

- Or organise your data as a `struct` array and use the `writeStruct2csv`
  function included in the notes. I think this is a good approach for working
  with behavioural data from PsychToolbox because the resulting data will
  be easy to analyse in `R`, `Python`, or SPSS.

Sometimes we want to store more complex data:

A typical use case for this might be for saving `struct`s

Here, we can see an example of creating a `struct` for storing some data about
a participant: 

```matlab
SubjectInfo = struct;
SubjectInfo.age = 19
SubjectInfo.Handedness = 'Left'
```

Because this data isn't matrix (or at least some kind of table) it's not
suitable for storing in a `.csv` file. 

We need an alternative. One alternative is to use `.json` files.

**JSON files**

- `.json` files are good for storing non-matrix data

- They're easy to import into `R` and `Python`

To save data as a `.json` file, you first need to **encode** it, and then you
can save it.

---

**Working with JSON files**

The first step to save data as a `.json` file is to encode the variable as JSON.

You can then write the data to a file using `fopen`, `fprintf`, and `fclose`.

Here is an example:
```matlab
JSONFile= 'example.json'
SubjectInfo_json = jsonencode(SubjectInfo);
fid = fopen(JSONFile, 'w');
fprintf(fid, SubjectInfo_json);
fclose(fid);
```

This is a good example of something you might want to write a function for! This
is what it might look like:


```matlab
function writeJSON(filename, variable)
  encoded_variable = jsonencode(variable);
  fid = fopen(filename, 'w');
  fprintf(fid, encoded_variable);
  fclose(fid);
end

```

---

### Working with JSON files in other languages

The big advantage of `.json` files is that they allow us to import structured
data into other programming languages

**Reading a JSON file into `R`**

```r
jsonlite::fromJSON('example.json')
```

**Reading a JSON file into `Python`**

```python
import json
with open('example.json') as f:
  data = json.load(f)
```
