# Scripts

Typing commands in the **Command Window** isn't very efficient because it doesn't allow us to save and re-use code. 

And often we'll want to save and re-use code for later use.

We can use **scripts** (files with an `.m` extension) to store a series of
commands that we can then re-run.

## <small>The search path</small>

The **search path** is a list of all the folders on your computer where `Matlab`
will look for `.m` files.

By default, the search path will include several folders related to `Matlab`
and a folder in your `Document` folder, usually something like:
  - `/Users/USERNAME/Documents/Matlab` or 
  - `C:/Users/USERNAME/Documents/Matlab`

You can *view* your search path with the `path` command:

```matlab
>> path

		MATLABPATH

	/Users/lc663/Documents/MATLAB
	/Users/lc663/matlab
	/Applications/MATLAB_R2019b.app/toolbox/matlab/timefun
```

search path, a folder not in the search path, and the current folder.

## Creating a script

The easiest way to create a new script (or function) file is with the `edit`
command.

Type `edit` followed by the name of the new file you want to create.

```matlab
>> edit say_hello.m
```

Valid names for script files:

1. Must be **one** word without spaces.

2. Has the extension `.m`

3. Doesn't start on a number

Helpfully, `Matlab` will show an error and give you a chance to edit the name if
you don't follow the rules!


---

## Creating a script

We can create a script called `say_hello.m`<sup>1</sup>

You can copy the code below into the editor window and save it!

```matlab
% A simple script
name = input('What is your name? ','s'); % ask your name
disp(['Hello ' name '! Pleased to meet you']); % say hello
```

Once we've saved the script, we can run it by typing its name at the command
prompt.

```matlab
>> say_hello
```

Or by using the `run` command with the filename (this is useful if the file is
**not** in our search path)

```matlab
>> run say_hello.m
```


.footnote[<sup>1</sup>You can also cut and paste the code for this script from
the [Part 1](/part1.html) page]

---

### Script sections

Our simple script has one section, but it can be useful to break scripts
down into sections.

Sections can be run *independently*, which can be useful when we're debugging
code.

To create a script section, do two comment symbols `%` on a line by
themselves.

```matlab
disp('I am section 1')

%%

disp('I am section 2')

```

You can run sections by clicking on the **Run Section** button on the toolbar,
or by hitting CTRL+ENTER / CMD+ENTER when your cursor is in a section.

---

## Adding help to a script

Back in Part I, we saw that we could get **help** on `Matlab` commands by using
the `help` command.

For example, to get help on the `randn` function: 

```matlab
>> help randn
```

The same works for scripts/functions you write yourself:

```matlab
>> help say_hello
  A simple script
```

Any comments at the start of the file are printed out when you ask for `help`.

A good habit is to write your own documentation (what gets printed out by
`help`) for any of the scripts and functions you write.
